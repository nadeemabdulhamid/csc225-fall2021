# Task: Profiling

After the line where our code prints out the size of the hash table:

```
System.out.println(table.size());
```

add some code to find the prefix that has the largest associated list of suffixes with it in the table when run on the `holmes.txt` input file. 

Answer the following questions in a comment at the bottom of your file:

1. What is the prefix?
2. What is the length of its list of suffixes?


# Task: Prefix size

Change the prefix size from `2` to `3`. 

3. How does the generated text compare between the two sizes of prefix?
4. What is the most common 3-word prefix and how many suffixes does it have in its list?
